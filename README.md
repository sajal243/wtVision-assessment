# Trip Planner Project

1. I have used React.js + SCSS + React-Router-Dom
2. After looking the json provided, I figured out the different categories which I listed in the leftbar.
3. Each category with reach the different route. Each route will change only the main component.
4. Header and Sidebar will remain stick
5. Tried to show the data regarding the each category using a single component which is making it dynamic for any level of  nesting in the value in the json
6. I am also using key attribute every where it need. So that reconcillation process can be faster.
7. I have also added a login page as per the given requirement
8. I am using dummy api for login which is giving me a access token and refresh token
9. Note: The access token is valid for 20 days, and the refresh token is valid for 10 hours.
10. Header will remain stick in any routing case. i.e. login or sidebar
11. Home button is used to get back user to home page of the app
12. I have also keep the best folder structure
13. Also making this page dynamic using config driven UI
14. Handled Responsiveness
